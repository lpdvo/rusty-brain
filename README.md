## rusty-brain
A amazingly fast brainfuck interpreter written in Rust.

This is nothing more than a side project to just see how to make a simple programming language. 
Not accepting pull requests.

### Usage
Simply download the compiled binary (if you're on windows that is), or compile the project with `cargo build`. 
Then simply run `./rusty-brain interpret <file name>.bf`

Why the `interpret` sub command you may ask? I might be adding a sub command for JIT and AOT compiling.
